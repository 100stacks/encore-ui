RxForm is a set of directives used to create forms throughout Encore. These directives provide a common HTML layout and style for all form elements, which helps ensure form accessibility and makes creating new forms easier.

**NOTE**: rxFormInput, rxFormRadio and rxFormSelect are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use rxFormItem for all your form input needs!
