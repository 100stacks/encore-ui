  This component may be used to provide feedback on the progress of a workflow or action.

<p>
  Encore Framework utilizes Angular Bootstrap <em>progressbar</em>. See the
  <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/progressbar">Angular Bootstrap page</a>
  for more details.

<ul class="list">
    <li>
      There are two states for progress bars: active and complete.
      Active progress bars have animated stripes, which are produced
      by the class <code>.active</code>. Full progress bars do not
      have this class, and are solid and static in appearance.</li>
    <li>
      Several options for displaying text with a progress bar are
      available: no text, a percentage (not italicized), and detailed
      text (italicized). Always try to show a percentage. Your focus
      should be to enter specific text, since it reveals both numeric
      progress and provides context for what progress is being tracked.
      See demo below.
    </li>
</ul>
