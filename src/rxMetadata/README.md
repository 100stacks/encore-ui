[API Documentation](/ngdocs/index.html#/api/rxMetadata)

`rxMetadata` contains directives to provide consistent styling for the display of metadata information.

## Organizing into Columns

It is highly recommended that you make use of `<section>` elements to separate metadata information into columns.

The `<section>` elements will be set to a fixed width and will wrap/stack if the container cannot fit all columns in a single row. *You can resize this page to see how the columns wrap.*
