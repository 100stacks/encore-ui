# rxModalAction

[![unstable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/unstable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Hook into Angular-UI Bootstrap's modal directive. Used as a link to open a modal window.

This module has a dependency on [Angular-UI Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/), so if it's going to be used, bootstrap needs to be included in your webpage.
