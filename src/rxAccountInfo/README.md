[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Functionality for populating an `rxInfoPanel` with a user's account details.

This component is very specific to internal Rackspace needs, but also lives as a demonstration on how to make
use of the `rxInfoBox`.

This directive requires that `SupportAccount`, `Encore`, and `Teams` services are available. These are not provided by this project,
but are available in an internal Rackspace repository.
