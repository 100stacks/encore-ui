  <h3>Page Wells</h3>
  <p>
    The <code>.well</code> class creates a well-effect &mdash; a box with significant
    padding and light gray background.  Page wells are used to communicated why
    data is not present for the user, usually if data can only be seen with
    permissions the user has not been granted.  In cases where a user is able
    to add data without a permissions change, a button can be displayed to
    prompt the user to add data.

  <h3>Modal Wells</h3>
  <p>
    Modal wells are used in the context of modals, typically to provide a
    summary of data entered or decisions made by the user in a form to provide
    a clearer picture to the user of the changes they are about to submit.
