<h3 class="title clear">Basics</h3>

<p>While buttons in Encore-UI can be marked up multiple ways: through <code>button</code>, <code>input type="button"</code> or <a href="http://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/#/component/rxButton">the rxButton direcitve</a>, which adds dynamic actions to loading indicators and messages - they should be styled using the <code>.button</code> class.</p>


    <h3 class="title clear">Customizing Buttons</h3>
    <div class="component-description clear">

        <p>Buttons are sized using <code>xl</code>, <code>lg</code>, <code>sm</code> and <code>xs</code> classes. Not adding the additional class defaults the size to medium.</p>

        <h2>Using Colors with Buttons</h2>

        <p><span class="msg-info">ENCORE-SPECIFIC:</span> In the context of the Encore-UI, when is a button blue and when is a button green?</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>If the form you are submitting results in CREATING or ADDING something, use green.</li>
            <li>If the form you are submitting is within a modal, use green.</li>
            <li>If the form you are submitting results in editing something or something auxiliary (like getting metadata from a different sources) keep it blue.</li>
            <li>If you are providing a button for the user to exit a series of modals (with no submit), use blue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using Spinners with Buttons</h2>

        <p>
            The Framework provides a spinner style for use with buttons. Note that different spinner styles are used when content is loading or being fetched (see <a href="#colors">Using Colors and Icons With Links demo</a>). When a user takes an action with results that cannot be immediately displayed, a spinner is shown on a disabled button state until the call completes or the results of the user's action can be displayed in the UI. Text for buttons with spinners should describe the action being taken using "-ing" verbs, so the user understands why the button appearance has changed. Note that the disabled state ensures the user cannot submit the same data multiple times while the initial action completes.

    <h3 class="title">Using Colors and Icons With Links</h2>
    <div class="component-description clear">

<h2 id="colors">Colors</h2>

<p>Status Classes are used to provide a clearer status regarding a simple message. Within the context of Encore, we use the following colors to convey action links:</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li>Green (<code>.msg-action</code>) is for create/add actions. When part of a list, they appear at the top.</li>
    <li>Blue (<code>.msg-info-blue</code>) is for edit/modify actions. When part of a list, they appear second.</li>
    <li>Orange (<code>.msg-info</code>) is for build an action upon something. When part of a list, they appear third.</li>
    <li>Red (<code>.msg-warn</code>) is for destructive actions. When part of a list, they appear last.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p><span class="msg-warn">HEADS UP:</span> Because these classes are colors, they can also be applied to regular text as well. This can cause confusion between when something is a text and something is an action. This is a design pattern discrepancy that will need to be resolved in a future iteration.</p>

<h2>Icons</h2>
<p>We've been using the <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> library as a way to primarily visualize actionable items. For the majority of Encore, actionable links are used in two places - in the upper right hand section of a details page, flushed right with the <code>page-actions</code> and <code>actions-area</code> classes, or in the rxActionMenu directive.</p>
<p>Below we have included some icons that have used throughout Encore, as well as the actions associated with the icons. Feel free to re-use these icons as you see fit.</p>

<p><span class="msg-warn">HEADS UP:</span> Most icons have been chosen based on the verb (Add, Edit, Delete, Restart, etc) but there are a couple of icons chosen on the noun (consoles, tachometers for throttling). This is a design pattern discrepancy that will need to be resolved in a future iteration.</p>
