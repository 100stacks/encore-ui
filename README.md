# What is EncoreUI?

EncoreUI is a library of reusable AngularJS widgets for internal Rackspace projects. While a few components are specific to Rackspace, most are generic enough to be used by any app.

# Getting Started

[A 'Getting Started' guide](./guides/getting-started.md) is available to help new projects get off the ground quickly.

# Demo App

You can see all components in action by visiting [the EncoreUI demo page](http://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/).

# Getting your tool in Encore

To receive support from the EncoreUI team, you must first be vetted through our application process. This provides us vital data that we need to understand your project, needs, resources, deadlines, etc. Without this information, our small team cannot adequately support you. Submit your application [through this request form on OneWiki](https://one.rackspace.com/display/rackertools/Submit+an+Encore+UI+Request).

Once you have submitted an application, we will contact you and begin our intake process. Due to limited resources on our end, the more lead time between submitting your application and any deadlines you have, the better, as the intake process and subsequent support from our team requires prioritization and may take several weeks. We require a minimum of two weeks lead time.

# General Support

To discuss bugs and features, please use [the GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/issues?state=open). To view the issues we're currently working on, check out the [EncoreUI Task Board](https://waffle.io/rackerlabs/encore-ui). For high-level questions and requests, you can e-mail the [EncoreUI mailing list](mailto:encoreui@lists.rackspace.com). Expect a response within one working day.
