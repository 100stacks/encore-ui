# What is Encore-UI?

Encore-UI is a library of reusable AngularJS widgets for internal Rackspace projects. At this point, it may not be usable for non-Rackspace projects. However, it is a great resource for learning our best practices.

# Getting Started

[A 'Getting Started' guide](./guides/getting-started.md) is available to help new projects get off the ground quickly.

# Demo App

You can see all components in action by visiting [the Encore-UI demo page](http://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/).

# Support

The preferred method of contacting the Encore-UI team is through [the Encore-UI public HipChat channel](http://www.hipchat.com/gb5dm7gzB). You do not need to have a registered HipChat account in order to chat; it's open to anyone with a browser.

One of the main reasons for using this channel over e-mail is that anyone on the channel can help out (versus having to be on the mailing list). It also favors quick back-and-forth communication, versus writing 100 e-mails back and forth.

You can also view the entire history of the chatroom if you have a HipChat account and are in the room via the HipChat app (under the name "Encore-UI").

If you live and die by IRC, there is also a room available on freenode.net at #encore-ui.

To discuss bugs and features, please use [the GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/issues?state=open). To get a better overview of what's currently being worked, check out the [Encore-UI Task Board](https://waffle.io/rackerlabs/encore-ui).
