# What is Encore-UI?

Encore-UI is a library of reusable AngularJS widgets for internal Rackspace projects. While a few components are specific to Rackspace, most are generic enough to be used by any app.

# Getting Started

[A 'Getting Started' guide](./guides/getting-started.md) is available to help new projects get off the ground quickly.

# Demo App

You can see all components in action by visiting [the Encore-UI demo page](http://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/).

# Support

To discuss bugs and features (or float ideas), please use [the GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/issues?state=open). To view the issues we're currently working on, check out the [Encore-UI Task Board](https://waffle.io/rackerlabs/encore-ui).

For technical support, we have two methods of contact. For high-level questions and requests, you can e-mail the [Encore-UI mailing list](encoreui@lists.rackspace.com). Expect a response within one working day.

If ongoing support is preferred, the Encore-UI team is available through [the Encore-UI Slack channel](https://rx-encore.slack.com/messages/framework/). One of the main reasons for using the Slack channel over e-mail is that it favors quick back-and-forth communication. You can also search the entire history of the chatroom if needed.

For access to the Slack channel, send a request through the Encore-UI mailing list.
