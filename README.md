# What is EncoreUI?

EncoreUI is a library of reusable AngularJS widgets for internal Rackspace projects. While a few components are specific to Rackspace, most are generic enough to be used by any app.

# Using EncoreUI In Your Own Project

To help guide you in getting a new project off the ground quickly, please reference ["Using EncoreUI In Your Own Project"](./guides/using-encoreui.md)

# Demo App

You can see all components in action by visiting [the EncoreUI demo page](http://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/).

# Getting your tool in Encore

To receive support from the EncoreUI team, you must first be vetted through our application process. This provides us vital data that we need to understand your project, needs, resources, and deadlines. Without this information, our small team cannot adequately support you. Submit an application [through this request form on OneWiki](https://one.rackspace.com/display/rackertools/Submit+an+Encore+UI+Request).

Once you have submitted an application, we will contact you and begin our intake process. Due to limited resources on our end, the intake process and subsequent support from our team requires prioritization and may take several weeks. We require a minimum of two weeks lead time.

# General Support

Our team can usually provide general assistance with using the Framework, but we do not create mock-ups of design for projects consuming the EncoreUI Framework.

To discuss bugs and features, please use [the GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/issues?state=open). To view the issues we're currently working on, check out the [EncoreUI Task Board](https://waffle.io/rackerlabs/encore-ui). For high-level questions and requests, you can e-mail the [EncoreUI mailing list](mailto:encoreui@lists.rackspace.com). Expect a response within one working day.
