<p>EncoreUI is a library of reusable AngularJS widgets for internal Rackspace projects. While a few components are specific to Rackspace, most are generic enough to be used by any app.</p>

<p>To receive support from the EncoreUI team, you must first be vetted through our application process. This provides us vital data that we need to understand your project, needs, resources, deadlines, etc. Without this information, our small team cannot adequately support you. Submit your application <a href="https://one.rackspace.com/display/rackertools/Submit+an+Encore+UI+Request">through this request form on OneWiki</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have submitted an application, we will contact you and begin our intake process. Due to limited resources on our end, the more lead time between submitting your application and any deadlines you have, the better, as the intake process and subsequent support from our team requires prioritization and may take several weeks. We require a minimum of two weeks lead time.</p>
